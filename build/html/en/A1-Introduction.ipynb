The Python modules of OpenJij call **cxxjij**, a Python library that wraps this C++ interface directly. The figure show the following inclusion relaationship.\n",

It is also easy to extend when implementing new algorithms. The following chapters will explain details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A module for holding the ising Hamiltonian's coefficient $J_{ij}$. There are `Dense` and `Sparse`, which deal with tight coupling (suitable for models in which all Jij have non-zero values) and others (suitable for models in whick many Jij values are zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "### System\n",
    "\n",
    "`system` defines a data structure for keeping the current status of the system in MonteCarlo simulation and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the following are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classical ising model (sequence of spins)\n",
    "- Ising model including transverse magnetic fields (sequence of spins including Trotter decomposition)\n",
    "- GPU implemented classical and quantum ising model\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different MonteCarlo methods and other computation schemes (or new methods will be developed in the feature). Therefore, by separating the data structures, algorithms and result fetching interfaces for each methods, OpenJij has been designed to make it easy to add different algorithms.\n",

    "### Updater\n",
    "\n",
    "`updater` difines how to update the `system`. Specifically, the following methods are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SingleSpinFlip Update\n",
    "- SwendsenWang Update\n",

    "`system` type determines which `updater` can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In core python interface, `updater` is integrated into the `algorithm`.\n",

    "`Algorithm` has a role of executing altorighms, including what schedule to run the annealing algorithm.\n",
    "`Algorithm_[Updater_type]_run` allows you to run the program using the corresponding Updater.\n",
